This is a guide to upgrading from previous versions of Project Tracker to version 2.5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first thing all users should do is backup the current database and code!  There
are a lot of changes in this new version and something will very possibly go wrong.
You may want to reference your old settings, or may want to try the upgrade again if
unsuccessful.

If you are running anything less than version 2.4.0, you need to first run the upgrade 
scripts for your version to catch up to speed.  This guide assumes you are working off 
of 2.4.x.

If you have run a previous version of the beta (prior to R3), you need to first run
the fixBeta.cfm script found in the "install/upgrade_from/2.4" directory.  This script
makes database modifications to match the latest changes to the "pt_user_notify" table.

The next thing all users need to do is to run the appropriate upgrade script for your 
database engine.  This will make a number of database changes, and will add some new 
tables.  If you receive any errors, please verify that the changes were made to the 
tables as specified in the update.  You may want to look through the script as each
area is commented and will give you an idea of what needs to be done.

All users should then run the "upgrade_2.4_step2.cfm" script which sets permissions
and notifications per project for each user based upon the user's previous settings.
This should only be done once the upgrade script from the last step has completed
successfully.  This file is also commented and you may want to review before upgrading.

Lastly, you should copy over the settings from your old config files to the current
config files.  You shouldn't just copy over the files as there are new settings that
have been added in this version.
