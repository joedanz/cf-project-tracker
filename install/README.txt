Project Tracker v2.6.3
by Joe Danziger (joe@ajaxcf.com)

Initial Release: June 5, 2007
Current Release: August 30, 2011

This application was inspired by Basecamp (http://www.basecamphq.com) 
put out by the 37signals crew.  Not too much documentation but 
hopefully most should be self explanatory.

INSTALLATION:
You need to edit the settings files in the config directory.
One is called when using the built in dev server on 127.0.0.1,
the settings.ini.cfm settings get called in any other instance.

The rootURL should be set to the site address without any trailing 
slash or directories - just the http:// plus the hostname or
IP address.  The mapping should be set to "/project" or wherever
you've placed the application - also with no trailing slash.

You also need to install the database tables.  This can be done through
an automated install script which is included in the root of the install
directory.  Manual install scripts are also included.  

The user table includes an admin and a guest user, plus 2 entries for 
default settings.  You can name your database whatever you'd like but 
make sure to match the settings in the config files.  The default 
password for the admin account is "admin", and for the guest, "guest".

If you change setting in the config files, you'll need to add 
"&reinit=1" at the end of any URL to refresh the system settings.

UPGRADING FROM OTHER VERSIONS:
There are upgrade scripts included in the install directory for the
various versions.  Please run the necessary DB and/or CF scripts. 
You may need to reinitialize you app by adding a "?reinit" on the 
end of a URL.  Also, be sure to keep the contents of your existing 
"userfiles" directory, which is stored under the web root by default.
Upgrades from version 2.4 or prior should pay attention to any 
additional files to run in the upgrade directories.

DEMO VERSION:
A demo of this app can currently be found at http://ajaxcf.com/project
This version if running on Open BlueDragon.  
You can login with username "admin" and password "admin".

ABOUT ROLES:
There are 3 possible roles a user can have.  Admins can make any changes
to any projects.  Project owners can edit project settings and add users
to projects.  Project users can contribute to any project they have been
assigned to (by an admin or project owner). 

ABOUT GOOGLE CALENDAR:
To use Google Calendar with Project Tracker, you must enable it in the 
Admin and provide login credentials.  Each Project uses it's own Calendar, 
which you'll need to create first using Google Calendar directly.  You can
then edit the Project Settings to select the calendar you'd like to use 
for that project.  All issues, to-dos, and milestones with a due date will
then publish to the corresponding Google Calendar.

REQUIREMENTS:
ColdFusion, BlueDragon, or Railo
CF8/BD/Railo required for avatars
mySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle
If on Railo, Strict Variable Scoping must be off. 

AUTO-LOGIN MODIFICATION:
To launch the application in an already logged in state as the guest user
(this is good for public views of projects), include "?guest" at the end
of your project URL.  If you use this as your project URLm you will still 
be able to logout and log back in as a different user.  You must still 
mofify the settings for the guest account to determine which projects are
accessible.
